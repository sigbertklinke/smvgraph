Description: Various visualisations (mosaic diagram, scatterplot matrix, Andrews curves, 
    parallel coordinate diagram, radar diagram, and Chernoff plots) and clustering methods 
    (k-means, agglomerative, EM clustering and DBSCAN) are implemented as Shiny apps. 
    All apps allow interactive changes, e.g. of the order of variables. 
    The apps are intended as teaching examples.
