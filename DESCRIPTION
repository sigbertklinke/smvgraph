Description: Various visualisations of univariate and multivariate graphs (e.g. mosaic diagram, scatterplot matrix, 
    Andrews curves, parallel coordinate diagram, radar diagram and Chernoff plots) as well as clustering methods 
    (e.g. k-means, agglomerative, EM clustering and DBSCAN) are implemented as a Shiny app. The app allows interactive
    changes, e.g. of the order of variables. It is intended for use in teaching.
